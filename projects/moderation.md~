### Moderation

The moderation team could operate independently of the rest of the
strike teams and would not have a defined timeframe for its goals. The
goals of the moderation team is to serve as an umbrella for the
moderators of language specific categories in the Rust Users Forum.

Each language specific IRC channel or Discourse category should have
one or more moderators able to communicate in the language. Also, each
language specific moderation team should have at least one member able
to communicate, in English, with the Rust Moderation Team.

The goals of the language specific moderation teams are the same as the
greater Rust Moderation Team.
