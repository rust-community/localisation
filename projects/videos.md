### Videos

All the videos added to the Rust Videos channel are tracked in the
[Rust sub-project of Mozillaâ€™s Amara
Team](https://amara.org/en/teams/mozilla/videos/?project=rust). Amara
provides a platform to easily subtitle and translate subtitles of
videos, and also has progress tracking capabilities built in. Keeping
the Rust Videos in the Mozilla team at Amara could make it easier to
get help from the Mozilla Video Localisation Team.

Some kind of prioritization criteria should be defined to be able to
reach out to collaborators on the different Language Sub-teams and
focus on the most important videos. This could avoid having people
dedicating time to videos on topics that are already obsolete, for
example. A bulk of videos could be marked for translation and promoted
through the different communication channels.

There should also be constant communication with the Mozilla Video
Localisation Team in order to keep the videos list up to date and to
try to get their collaboration and guidance on the
internationalization work.
